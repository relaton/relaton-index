This gem is a part of [Relaton](https://github.com/relaton) project. It provides a way to index Relaton documents' files and search them by references.

== Installation

Install the gem and add it to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add relaton-index

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install relaton-index

== Usage

[source,ruby]
----
require 'relaton/index'

# Create a new index object. The first argument is the type of dataset (ISO, IEC, IHO, etc.) URL and filename are optional.
Relaton::Index.find_or_create :IHO, url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relaton/relaton-data-iho/master/index.zip", filename: "index-iho.yaml"

# Find an existing index object (created before).
Relaton::Index.find_or_create :IHO

# If the URL or filename is specified and has a new value (different from what it was before), the index object will be recreated.
Relaton::Index.find_or_create :IHO, url: nil, filename: "index.yaml"

# Remove the index from the pool.
Relaton::Index.close :IHO
----

The aim of this gem is to be used by Relaton libraries in two ways:
- indexing documents' files in GitHub repositories
- searching a document by a reference when the Relaton library fetches a document

=== Indexing

In this case, the Relaton library creates an index object and adds documents' files to it. By default, the index object is saved to the `index.yaml` file in the root of the repository. The filename can be changed using the `filename` setting.

[source,ruby]
---- 
# Create a new index object or fetch an existing one. The first argument is the type of dataset (ISO, IEC, IHO, etc.) URL should not be specified.
index = Relaton::Index.find_or_create :IHO

# Add a document to the index or update it if it already exists.
index.add_or_update id: "B-4 2.19.0", file: "data/b-4_2_19_0.xml"

# Save the index to the `index.yaml` file in the current directory.
index.save
----

=== Searching

In this case, the Relaton library should create an index object and search for a document by reference. The gem looks for the `.relaton/[TYPE]/index.yaml` file in the user's home directory. The `[TYPE]` is one of downcased ISO, IEC, IHO, etc. If the file is not found or is older than 24 hours then it will be downloaded from the URL specified in the `find_or_create` method.

[source,ruby]
----
# Create a new index object or fetch an existing one. URL should be specified. If the index file is not found or is older than 24 hours, it will be downloaded from the URL. By default, the index is saved as `index.yaml` file to the `/[HOME]/.relaton/iho/` folder.
index = Relaton::Index.find_or_create :IHO, url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relaton/relaton-data-iho/master/index.zip"


# Search for a document by reference 
index.search "B-4" 
# => [{ id: "B-4 2.19.0", file: "data/b-4_2_19_0.xml" }] 

# Search for a document by reference using a block
index.search do |row|
  # do something with the index row
  row[:id] == "B-4"
end
# => [{ id: "B-4 2.19.0", file: "data/b-4_2_19_0.xml" }] 
----

=== Remove all index records

This method removes all records from the index object. The index file is not removed.

[source,ruby]
----
index.remove_all
----

=== Remove index file

This method removes the index file. The index object is cleared and can be used for indexing or loading a file from the specified URL.

[source,ruby]
----
index.remove
----

=== Configuration

The gem can be configured by using the `Relaton::Index.config` method. The following settings are available:

- `filename` - the name of the index file. By default, it is `index.yaml`.
- `storage` - the storage class or module. By default, it is `FileStorage` module. It can be any class or module that implements the `ctime`, `read`, and `write` class methods.
- `storage_dir` - the directory where the `.relaton/[TYPE]` folder is created. By default, it's a user's home dir. This setting works only when the gem is used for searching. When indexing, the index is always saved in a current folder.

[source,ruby]
----
Relaton::Index.config do |config|
  config.filename = "index-new.yaml"
  config.storage = S3Storage
  config.storage_dir = "/"
end
----

It's also possible to redefine file name for a specific type of index:
[source,ruby]
----
index = Relaton::Index.find_or_create :IHO, filename: "index-iho.yaml"
----

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
